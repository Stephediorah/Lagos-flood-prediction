# Lagos-flood-prediction

This report presents an analytical approach to forecasting future flood events in Lagos using historical
weather data spanning from 2019 to 2024.
In this study, we employed machine learning techniques to predict flood occurrences based on
various meteorological factors. The dataset includes comprehensive weather variables such as
temperature, humidity, precipitation, wind speed, and atmospheric pressure, which are critical in
understanding the dynamics of flood events. By leveraging the Random Forest classifier, a
robust and widely-used model for classification tasks, we aimed to identify periods of high flood
risk.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Interpretation:

This dataset used covers a comprehensive period from 2019 to 2024, providing a robust basis
for analysis. The features used in the model include datetime, precipitation, humidity,
temperature, wind speed, and other weather conditions, which are critical factors influencing
flood events. The dataset was cleaned, missing values were handled, and relevant features
were selected. Aggregating precipitation data by month helped in understanding seasonal
patterns.

Model Selection:

To perform the future flood predictions, there are different models that can be applied to forecast
this data. These models can be either found in PYTHON, PowerBI, R etc. The selected model
used to analyze the future flood prediction for this project is the RandomForestClassifier using
python.

Random Forest Classifier: The Random Forest classifier was chosen for its robustness and
ability to handle non-linear relationships between features and the target variable. It also
provides feature importance, which helps in understanding which factors are most influential in
predicting floods.T he model predicted the likelihood of flood events for each future date based
on the simulated weather data.

CONCLUSION

The forecast for future flood events in Lagos is based on a comprehensive analysis of historical
weather data and the application of a robust Random Forest classifier. The model's high
predictive accuracy, validated by historical flood data, and its ability to identify seasonal
precipitation patterns provide a reliable basis for anticipating flood risks. This data-driven
approach ensures that the forecast is grounded in empirical evidence, enabling better flood
preparedness and mitigation strategies for the region.
